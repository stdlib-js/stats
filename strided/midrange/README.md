# midrange

> Calculate the [mid-range][mid-range] of a strided array.

<section class="intro">

The [**mid-range**][mid-range], or **mid-extreme**, is the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum values in a data set. The measure is the midpoint of the range and a measure of central tendency.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var midrange = require( '@stdlib/stats/strided/midrange' );
```

#### midrange( N, x, strideX )

Computes the [mid-range][mid-range] of a strided array.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, 2.0 ];

var v = midrange( x.length, x, 1 );
// returns 0.0
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **N**: number of indexed elements.
-   **x**: input [`Array`][mdn-array] or [`typed array`][mdn-typed-array].
-   **strideX**: stride length for `x`.

The `N` and stride parameters determine which elements in the strided array are accessed at runtime. For example, to compute the [mid-range][mid-range] of every other element in `x`,

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, -7.0, -2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0 ];

var v = midrange( 4, x, 2 );
// returns 1.0
```

Note that indexing is relative to the first index. To introduce an offset, use [`typed array`][mdn-typed-array] views.

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/capitalized-comments -->

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array/float64' );

var x0 = new Float64Array( [ 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, -2.0, -2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ] );
var x1 = new Float64Array( x0.buffer, x0.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT*1 ); // start at 2nd element

var v = midrange( 4, x1, 2 );
// returns 1.0
```

#### midrange.ndarray( N, x, strideX, offsetX )

Computes the [mid-range][mid-range] of a strided array using alternative indexing semantics.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, 2.0 ];

var v = midrange.ndarray( x.length, x, 1, 0 );
// returns 0.0
```

The function has the following additional parameters:

-   **offsetX**: starting index for `x`.

While [`typed array`][mdn-typed-array] views mandate a view offset based on the underlying buffer, the offset parameter supports indexing semantics based on a starting index. For example, to calculate the [mid-range][mid-range] for every other element in `x` starting from the second element

```javascript
var x = [ 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, -2.0, -2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ];

var v = midrange.ndarray( 4, x, 2, 1 );
// returns 1.0
```

## Notes

-   If `N <= 0`, both functions return `NaN`.
-   Depending on the environment, the typed versions ([`dmidrange`][@stdlib/stats/strided/dmidrange], [`smidrange`][@stdlib/stats/strided/smidrange], etc.) are likely to be significantly more performant.
-   Both functions support array-like objects having getter and setter accessors for array element access (e.g., [`@stdlib/array/base/accessor`][@stdlib/array/base/accessor]).

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/array/discrete-uniform' );
var midrange = require( '@stdlib/stats/strided/midrange' );

var x = discreteUniform( 10, -50, 50, {
    'dtype': 'float64'
});
console.log( x );

var v = midrange( x.length, x, 1 );
console.log( v );
```
