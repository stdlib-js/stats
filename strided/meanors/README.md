## Usage

```javascript
var meanors = require( '@stdlib/stats/strided/meanors' );
```

#### meanors( N, x, strideX )

Computes the [arithmetic mean][arithmetic-mean] of a strided array using ordinary recursive summation.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, 2.0 ];

var v = meanors( x.length, x, 1 );
// returns ~0.3333
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **N**: number of indexed elements.
-   **x**: input [`Array`][mdn-array] or [`typed array`][mdn-typed-array].
-   **strideX**: stride length for `x`.

The `N` and stride parameters determine which elements in the strided array are accessed at runtime. For example, to compute the [arithmetic mean][arithmetic-mean] of every other element in `x`,

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, -7.0, -2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0 ];

var v = meanors( 4, x, 2 );
// returns 1.25
```

Note that indexing is relative to the first index. To introduce an offset, use [`typed array`][mdn-typed-array] views.

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/capitalized-comments -->

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array/float64' );

var x0 = new Float64Array( [ 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, -2.0, -2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ] );
var x1 = new Float64Array( x0.buffer, x0.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT*1 ); // start at 2nd element

var v = meanors( 4, x1, 2 );
// returns 1.25
```

#### meanors.ndarray( N, x, strideX, offsetX )

Computes the [arithmetic mean][arithmetic-mean] of a strided array using ordinary recursive summation and alternative indexing semantics.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, 2.0 ];

var v = meanors.ndarray( x.length, x, 1, 0 );
// returns ~0.33333
```

The function has the following additional parameters:

-   **offsetX**: starting index for `x`.

While [`typed array`][mdn-typed-array] views mandate a view offset based on the underlying buffer, the offset parameter supports indexing semantics based on a starting index. For example, to calculate the [arithmetic mean][arithmetic-mean] for every other element in `x` starting from the second element

```javascript
var x = [ 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, -2.0, -2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ];

var v = meanors.ndarray( 4, x, 2, 1 );
// returns 1.25
```

## Notes

-   If `N <= 0`, both functions return `NaN`.
-   Ordinary recursive summation (i.e., a "simple" sum) is performant, but can incur significant numerical error. If performance is paramount and error tolerated, using ordinary recursive summation to compute an arithmetic mean is acceptable; in all other cases, exercise due caution.
-   Both functions support array-like objects having getter and setter accessors for array element access (e.g., [`@stdlib/array/base/accessor`][@stdlib/array/base/accessor]).
-   Depending on the environment, the typed versions ([`dmeanors`][@stdlib/stats/strided/dmeanors], [`smeanors`][@stdlib/stats/base/smeanors], etc.) are likely to be significantly more performant.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/array/discrete-uniform' );
var meanors = require( '@stdlib/stats/strided/meanors' );

var x = discreteUniform( 10, -50, 50, {
    'dtype': 'float64'
});
console.log( x );

var v = meanors( x.length, x, 1 );
console.log( v );
