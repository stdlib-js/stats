/**
* Computes the standard deviation of an array using a one-pass trial mean algorithm.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   Setting the correction parameter to a value other than `0` has the effect of adjusting the divisor during the calculation of the standard deviation according to `N-c` where `c` corresponds to the provided degrees of freedom adjustment. When computing the standard deviation of a population, setting the correction parameter to `0` is the standard choice (i.e., the provided array contains data constituting an entire population). When computing the corrected sample standard deviation, setting the correction parameter to `1` is the standard choice (i.e., the provided array contains data sampled from a larger population; this is commonly referred to as Bessel's correction).
*
* @param x - input array
* @param correction - degrees of freedom adjustment (default: 1.0)
* @returns standard deviation
*
* @example
* var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, 2.0 ];
*
* var v = stdevch( x, 1.0 );
* // returns ~2.0817
