Often in the analysis of data, the true population [standard deviation][standard-deviation] is not known _a priori_ and must be estimated from a sample drawn from the population distribution. If one attempts to use the formula for the population [standard deviation][standard-deviation], the result is biased and yields an **uncorrected sample standard deviation**. To compute a **corrected sample standard deviation** for a sample of size `n`,

The use of the term `n-1` is commonly referred to as Bessel's correction. Note, however, that applying Bessel's correction can increase the mean squared error between the sample standard deviation and population standard deviation. Depending on the characteristics of the population distribution, other correction factors (e.g., `n-1.5`, `n+1`, etc) can yield better estimators.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var nanstdevtk = require( '@stdlib/stats/array/nanstdevtk' );
```

#### nanstdevtk( x\[, correction] )

Computes the [standard deviation][standard-deviation] of an array ignoring `NaN` values and using a one-pass textbook algorithm.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, NaN, 2.0 ];

var v = nanstdevtk( x );
// returns ~2.0817
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **x**: input array.
-   **correction**: degrees of freedom adjustment. Setting this parameter to a value other than `0` has the effect of adjusting the divisor during the calculation of the [standard deviation][standard-deviation] according to `N-c` where `N` corresponds to the number of non-`NaN` array elements and `c` corresponds to the provided degrees of freedom adjustment. When computing the [standard deviation][standard-deviation] of a population, setting this parameter to `0` is the standard choice (i.e., the provided array contains data constituting an entire population). When computing the unbiased sample [standard deviation][standard-deviation], setting this parameter to `1` is the standard choice (i.e., the provided array contains data sampled from a larger population; this is commonly referred to as Bessel's correction). Default: `1.0`.

By default, the function computes the sample [standard deviation][standard-deviation]. To adjust the degrees of freedom when computing the [standard deviation][standard-deviation], provide a `correction` argument.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, NaN, 2.0 ];

var v = nanstdevtk( x, 0.0 );
// returns ~1.6997
```

## Notes

-   If provided an empty array, the function returns `NaN`.
-   If `N - c` is less than or equal to `0` (where `c` corresponds to the provided degrees of freedom adjustment and `N` corresponds to the number of non-`NaN` array elements), the function returns `NaN`.
-   The function supports array-like objects having getter and setter accessors for array element access (e.g., [`@stdlib/array/base/accessor`][@stdlib/array/base/accessor]).
-   Some caution should be exercised when using the one-pass textbook algorithm. Literature overwhelmingly discourages the algorithm's use for two reasons: 1) the lack of safeguards against underflow and overflow and 2) the risk of catastrophic cancellation when subtracting the two sums if the sums are large and the variance small. These concerns have merit; however, the one-pass textbook algorithm should not be dismissed outright. For data distributions with a moderately large standard deviation to mean ratio (i.e., **coefficient of variation**), the one-pass textbook algorithm may be acceptable, especially when performance is paramount and some precision loss is acceptable (including a risk of computing a negative variance due to floating-point rounding errors!). In short, no single "best" algorithm for computing the standard deviation exists. The "best" algorithm depends on the underlying data distribution, your performance requirements, and your minimum precision requirements. When evaluating which algorithm to use, consider the relative pros and cons, and choose the algorithm which best serves your needs.
