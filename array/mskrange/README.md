# mskrange

> Calculate the [range][range] of an array according to a mask.

<section class="intro">

The [**range**][range] is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

</section>

<!-- /.intro -->

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var mskrange = require( '@stdlib/stats/array/mskrange' );
```

#### mskrange( x, mask )

Computes the [range][range] of an array according to a mask.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, 4.0, 2.0 ];
var mask = [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ];

var v = mskrange( x, mask );
// returns 4.0
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **x**: input array.
-   **mask**: mask array. If a `mask` array element is `0`, the corresponding element in `x` is considered valid and **included** in computation. If a `mask` array element is `1`, the corresponding element in `x` is considered invalid/missing and **excluded** from computation.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If provided an empty array, the function returns `NaN`.
-   The function supports array-like objects having getter and setter accessors for array element access (e.g., [`@stdlib/array/base/accessor`][@stdlib/array/base/accessor]).

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var uniform = require( '@stdlib/random/array/uniform' );
var bernoulli = require( '@stdlib/random/array/bernoulli' );
var mskrange = require( '@stdlib/stats/array/mskrange' );

var x = uniform( 10, -50.0, 50.0, {
    'dtype': 'float64'
});
console.log( x );

var mask = bernoulli( x.length, 0.2, {
    'dtype': 'uint8'
});
console.log( mask );

var v = mskrange( x, mask );
console.log( v );
```
