{{alias}}( x[, correction] )
    Computes the variance of an array ignoring `NaN` values and using a
    one-pass textbook algorithm.

    If provided an empty array, the function returns `NaN`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: Array<number>|TypedArray
        Input array.

    correction: number (optional)
        Degrees of freedom adjustment. Setting this parameter to a value other
        than `0` has the effect of adjusting the divisor during the calculation
        of the variance according to `N - c` where `N` corresponds to the number
        of array elements and `c` corresponds to the provided degrees of freedom
        adjustment. When computing the variance of a population, setting this
        parameter to `0` is the standard choice (i.e., the provided array
        contains data constituting an entire population). When computing the
        unbiased sample variance, setting this parameter to `1` is the standard
        choice (i.e., the provided array contains data sampled from a larger
        population; this is commonly referred to as Bessel's correction).
        Default: 1.0.

    Returns
    -------
    out: number
        Variance.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, NaN, 2.0 ];
    > {{alias}}( x, 1.0 )
    ~4.3333
