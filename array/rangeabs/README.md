# rangeabs

> Calculate the [range][range] of absolute values of an array.

<section class="intro">

The [**range**][range] is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

</section>

<!-- /.intro -->

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var rangeabs = require( '@stdlib/stats/array/rangeabs' );
```

#### rangeabs( x )

Computes the [range][range] of absolute values of an array.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, 2.0 ];

var v = rangeabs( x );
// returns 1.0
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **x**: input array.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If provided an empty array, the function returns `NaN`.
-   The function supports array-like objects having getter and setter accessors for array element access (e.g., [`@stdlib/array/base/accessor`][@stdlib/array/base/accessor]).

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/array/discrete-uniform' );
var rangeabs = require( '@stdlib/stats/array/rangeabs' );

var x = discreteUniform( 10, -50, 50, {
    'dtype': 'float64'
});
console.log( x );

var v = rangeabs( x );
console.log( v );
```
