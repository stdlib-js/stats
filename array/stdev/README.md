Often in the analysis of data, the true population [standard deviation][standard-deviation] is not known _a priori_ and must be estimated from a sample drawn from the population distribution. If one attempts to use the formula for the population [standard deviation][standard-deviation], the result is biased and yields an **uncorrected sample standard deviation**. To compute a **corrected sample standard deviation** for a sample of size `n`,

The use of the term `n-1` is commonly referred to as Bessel's correction. Note, however, that applying Bessel's correction can increase the mean squared error between the sample standard deviation and population standard deviation. Depending on the characteristics of the population distribution, other correction factors (e.g., `n-1.5`, `n+1`, etc) can yield better estimators.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var stdev = require( '@stdlib/stats/array/stdev' );
```

#### stdev( x\[, correction] )

Computes the [standard deviation][standard-deviation] of an array.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, 2.0 ];

var v = stdev( x );
// returns ~2.0817
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **x**: input array.
-   **correction**: degrees of freedom adjustment. Setting this parameter to a value other than `0` has the effect of adjusting the divisor during the calculation of the [standard deviation][standard-deviation] according to `N-c` where `N` corresponds to the number of array elements and `c` corresponds to the provided degrees of freedom adjustment. When computing the [standard deviation][standard-deviation] of a population, setting this parameter to `0` is the standard choice (i.e., the provided array contains data constituting an entire population). When computing the unbiased sample [standard deviation][standard-deviation], setting this parameter to `1` is the standard choice (i.e., the provided array contains data sampled from a larger population; this is commonly referred to as Bessel's correction). Default: `1.0`.

By default, the function computes the sample [standard deviation][standard-deviation]. To adjust the degrees of freedom when computing the [standard deviation][standard-deviation], provide a `correction` argument.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, 2.0 ];

var v = stdev( x, 0.0 );
// returns ~1.6997
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If provided an empty array, the function returns `NaN`.
-   If `N - c` is less than or equal to `0` (where `c` corresponds to the provided degrees of freedom adjustment), both functions return `NaN`.
-   The function supports array-like objects having getter and setter accessors for array element access (e.g., [`@stdlib/array/base/accessor`][@stdlib/array/base/accessor]).
