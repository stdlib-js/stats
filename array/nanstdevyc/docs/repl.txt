{{alias}}( x[, correction] )
    Computes the standard deviation of an array ignoring `NaN` values and using
    a one-pass algorithm proposed by Youngs and Cramer.

    If provided an empty array, the function returns `NaN`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: Array<number>|TypedArray
        Input array.

    correction: number (optional)
        Degrees of freedom adjustment. Setting this parameter to a value other
        than `0` has the effect of adjusting the divisor during the calculation
        of the standard deviation according to `N-c` where `N` corresponds to
        the number of non-NaN array elements and `c` corresponds to the provided
        degrees of freedom adjustment. When computing the standard deviation of
        a population, setting this parameter to `0` is the standard choice
        (i.e., the provided array contains data constituting an entire
        population). When computing the unbiased sample standard deviation,
        setting this parameter to `1` is the standard choice (i.e., the
        provided array contains data sampled from a larger population; this is
        commonly referred to as Bessel's correction). Default: 1.0.

    Returns
    -------
    out: number
        The standard deviation.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, NaN, 2.0 ];
    > {{alias}}( x, 1.0 )
    ~2.0817
