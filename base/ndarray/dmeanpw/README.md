## Usage

```javascript
var dmeanpw = require( '@stdlib/stats/base/ndarray/dmeanpw' );
```

#### dmeanpw( arrays )

Computes the [arithmetic mean][arithmetic-mean] of a one-dimensional double-precision floating-point ndarray using pairwise summation.

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array/float64' );
var ndarray = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor' );

var xbuf = new Float64Array( [ 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0 ] );
var x = new ndarray( 'float64', xbuf, [ 4 ], [ 1 ], 0, 'row-major' );

var v = dmeanpw( [ x ] );
// returns 2.5
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **arrays**: array-like object containing a one-dimensional input ndarray.

## Notes

-   If provided an empty one-dimensional ndarray, the function returns `NaN`.
-   In general, pairwise summation is more numerically stable than ordinary recursive summation (i.e., "simple" summation), with slightly worse performance. While not the most numerically stable summation technique (e.g., compensated summation techniques such as the Kahan–Babuška-Neumaier algorithm are generally more numerically stable), pairwise summation strikes a reasonable balance between numerical stability and performance. If either numerical stability or performance is more desirable for your use case, consider alternative summation techniques.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/array/discrete-uniform' );
var ndarray = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor' );
var ndarray2array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/to-array' );
var dmeanpw = require( '@stdlib/stats/base/ndarray/dmeanpw' );

var xbuf = discreteUniform( 10, -50, 50, {
    'dtype': 'float64'
});
var x = new ndarray( 'float64', xbuf, [ xbuf.length ], [ 1 ], 0, 'row-major' );
console.log( ndarray2array( x ) );

var v = dmeanpw( [ x ] );
console.log( v );
```
