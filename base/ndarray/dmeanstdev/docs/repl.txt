{{alias}}( arrays )
    Computes the mean and standard deviation of a one-dimensional double-
    precision floating-point ndarray.

    If provided an empty ndarray, the function returns `NaN` values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays: ArrayLikeObject<ndarray>
        Array-like object containing the following ndarrays in order:

        - a one-dimensional input ndarray.
        - a one-dimensional output ndarray to store the mean and standard
        deviation.
        - a zero-dimensional ndarray specifying the degrees of freedom
        adjustment. Setting this to a value other than 0 has the effect of
        adjusting the divisor during the calculation of the standard deviation
        according to N-c where c corresponds to the provided degrees of freedom
        adjustment. When computing the standard deviation of a population,
        setting this to 0 is the standard choice (i.e., the provided array
        contains data constituting an entire population). When computing the
        corrected sample standard deviation, setting this to 1 is the standard
        choice (i.e., the provided array contains data sampled from a larger
        population; this is commonly referred to as Bessel's correction).

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        An ndarray containing the mean and standard deviation.

    Examples
    --------
    > var xbuf = new {{alias:@stdlib/array/float64}}( [ 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, -2.0 ] );
    > var dt = 'float64';
    > var sh = [ xbuf.length ];
    > var sx = [ 1 ];
    > var ox = 0;
    > var ord = 'row-major';
    > var x = new {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/ctor}}( dt, xbuf, sh, sx, ox, ord );
    > var o = new {{alias:@stdlib/array/float64}}( 2 );
    > var out = new {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/ctor}}( dt, o, [ 2 ], [ 1 ], ox, ord );
    > var opts = { 'dtype': dt };
    > var correction = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/from-scalar}}( 1.0, opts );
    > {{alias}}( [ x, out, correction ] );
    > var arr = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/to-array}}( out )
